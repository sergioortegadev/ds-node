# Sergio's node calculator

## I present to you my calculator by CLI.

## Here is the documentation:

### run `node calc.js` in the terminal and then request the operation you want to perform (in spanish). Values must be expressed in numbers, not letters. All this between quotation marks ("" or '', not ``), be careful to put the same quotes when opening and closing.

### This program only allows you to do a single operation for each execution, for example: we cannot ask to subtract, and then divide the result. For this reason, if we indicate several operations in the same execution, it will search in this order: addition, subtraction, multiplication and then division.

### If it recognizes any operation, it will show the result, otherwise it will indicate that it is not recognized and will help the user to request it again.

### In the case of addition and multiplication, it will perform the selected operation with all the numbers entered. In case of subtraction, the first one found will be subtracted from the following ones. In case of division, it will do the operation with the first two numbers found, except that the second number is zero.

### Decimals are indicated with a point "." therefore do not use points when writing the order.
